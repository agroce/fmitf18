\subsection{Improving Software System Reliability}

A key element of broader outreach will be to report bugs discovered
during our testing experiments, and contribute test suites to open
source projects.  To that end, we will primarily target real world
systems with our experiments, in hopes of improving their quality,
reliability, and test suites.  While we expect to develop more
examples, our current infrastructure includes automated testing for
Google and Mozilla JavaScript engines, a variety of C compilers
(including GCC and LLVM), the YAFFS2 \cite{yaffs2} embedded flash file
system, Google's Go compiler, a large set of Unix utilities, various
Python libraries (including the most widely used library, and key
scientific and numeric analysis packages), and a set of Android
applications.  In previous work, discussions with working test
engineers at Mozilla, Google, and NASA have significantly informed our
research progress, and we expect this to continue.  In addition to
simply reporting bugs, we aim to provide enhancements to tools
(C-Reduce and TSTL) that engineers can use, and in the case of TSTL,
easily modified packages for testing Python libraries that can be
tuned to developer needs.
