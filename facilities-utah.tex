This project has adequate computational and research facilities at par with any
top-tier research department.
%
The computing facility at the School of Computing consists of over 600 desktop
machines and servers running a variety of operating systems (Linux, Windows, and
OS X).
%
All machines (outside of core facility servers) are available for use by
everyone with an account in the School of Computing, and are collectively
referred to as the Facility.
%
A professional IT staff is responsible for administering our facility.
%
In addition, we have easy access to the Emulab facility at the department
(\url{http://www.emulab.net}) and the facilities of the SCI Institute
(\url{http://www.sci.utah.edu}).
